/** getUpdates
  *
  * Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (wiki). An Array of Update objects is returned.
  *
  * @param offset   Integer	Optional	Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates. By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an offset higher than its update_id. The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates will forgotten.
  * @param limit    Integer	Optional	Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1â€”100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.
  * @param timeout  Integer	Optional	Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling
  *
  * Notes
  *   1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up.
  *   2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response.
